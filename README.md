# Les elfes de maison

## Project Description

The way to a human's heart often leads through the stomach. The beauty of cooking is multifaceted. Not only do good cooking habits lead more or less directly to healthier eating, and by extension to our overall well-being, but cooking is also a highly social activity. Who doesn't love gathering for an evening with friends and preparing delicious recipes together?

However, especially in large cities, many people lack access to a kitchen that enables them to cook with friends.

This web application was born from the idea of uniting young people living in large cities, who lack access to a proper kitchen, and those who own kitchens in their homes and are willing to share them for a communal cooking experience. The application provides a platform that allows kitchen owners to create a cooking event for a desired date.

People can then request to participate in these events by proposing recipes. The website manages all details concerning the organization of the event and supports its users in creating unique shared cooking experiences.

## Who We are ? 

Who better to develop such a project than two young individuals living in a city where students often reside in rooms smaller than Harry's first room at Privet Drive?

We are Yassine and Yannick, a Designer and Data Scientist respectively, residing in two compact yet beautiful rooms in the heart of Paris. Besides our shared passion for innovation and creativity, we both have a deep love for delicious and freshly cooked food.
