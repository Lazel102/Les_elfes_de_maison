# Les elfes de maison

## Project Description

The way to a human's heart often leads through the stomach. The beauty of cooking is multifaceted. Not only do good cooking habits lead more or less directly to healthier eating, and by extension to our overall well-being, but cooking is also a highly social activity. Who doesn't love gathering for an evening with friends and preparing delicious recipes together?

However, especially in large cities, many people lack access to a kitchen that enables them to cook with friends.

This web application was born from the idea of uniting young people living in large cities, who lack access to a proper kitchen, and those who own kitchens in their homes and are willing to share them for a communal cooking experience. The application provides a platform that allows kitchen owners to create a cooking event for a desired date.

People can then request to participate in these events by proposing recipes. The website manages all details concerning the organization of the event and supports its users in creating unique shared cooking experiences.

## Who We are ? 

Who would be a better fit for developing such a project as two young people living in a city where young people tend to live in rooms that are smaller then Harry's first room in Privet Drive. 

We are Yassine and Yannick, a Designer and a Data Scientist living in two small but beatutifull rooms in the center of paris and sharing among our love for projects also a love for delicous and freshed cook food.
